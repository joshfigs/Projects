Overview: This is a project that was introduced in my Data Structures class. It was not given for credit but was recommended for good practice. My program is a Java implementation of a BigInteger class, which provides functionality to perform arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large integers. It includes methods for parsing integers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conversion to string. The program handles negative numbers, leading zeros, and edge cases like overflow and underflow. It also features a testing framework to ensure the correctness of its operations. The program leverages linked lists of DigitNode objects to represent large integers. The BigInteger class utilizes these linked lists to store the individual digits of the integer. The DigitNode class represents each node in the linked list, containing an integer digit and a reference to the next node. The BigInteger class performs arithmetic operations and other manipulations directly on these linked lists of DigitNode objects. The methods of the BigInteger class (add, mutliply, parse) traverse the linked list of DigitNode objects, extracting each digit and concatenating them into a string to represent the integer value.
